# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


### Loading and preprocessing the data

Read activity.csv file into "activity" variable
	activity <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/BlackBeast/Documents/GitHub/RepData_PeerAssessment1/activity/activity.csv")

Convert date field from factor to date

	activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)

Load reshape2 library to get melt & dcast functions

	library(reshape2)

Melt data frame to prep for casting by date -- by setting the id variable to date and the measure variable to steps, we get a table with multiple values for steps taken within each day

	actMeltDate <- melt(activity, id.vars="date", measure.vars="steps", na.rm=FALSE)

Cast data frame to see steps per day -- this sums the steps by date to give us a table of 3 columns x 61 rows

	actCastDate <- dcast(actMeltDate, date ~ variable, sum)

Plot histogram with frequency of steps by day and add a red line showing the mean value

	plot(actCastDate$date, actCastDate$steps, type="h", main="Histogram of Daily Steps", xlab="Date", ylab="Steps per Day", col="blue", lwd=8)
	abline(h=mean(actCastDate$steps, na.rm=TRUE), col="red", lwd=2)

### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Calculate mean and median of daily steps

	paste("Mean Steps per Day =", mean(actCastDate$steps, na.rm=TRUE))

[1] "Mean Steps per Day = 10766.1886792453"

	paste("Median Steps per Day =", median(actCastDate$steps, na.rm=TRUE))

[1] "Median Steps per Day = 10765"

### What is the average daily activity pattern?

Re-melt data frame to prep for casting by interval, including removing NA values so we can take the mean a little later

	actMeltInt <- melt(activity, id.vars="interval", measure.vars="steps", na.rm=TRUE)

Cast data frame to see mean steps per interval

	actCastInt <- dcast(actMeltInt, interval ~ variable, mean)

Plot line chart with average frequency of steps by interval and add line with mean

	plot(actCastInt$interval, actCastInt$steps, type="l", main="Frequency of Steps Taken at Each Interval", xlab="Interval ID", ylab="Steps", col="orange", lwd=2)
	abline(h=mean(actCastInt$steps, na.rm=TRUE), col="red", lwd=2)

The plot shows the peak at somewhere in the 800-900 interval range so let's find out exactly which interval has the max value and what that maximum value is
Output interval that has max value along with the max value

	paste("Interval with max value =", actCastInt$interval[which(actCastInt$steps == max(actCastInt$steps))])

[1] "Interval with max value = 835"

	paste("Maximum interval mean steps =", max(actCastInt$steps))

[1] "Maximum interval mean steps = 206.169811320755"

### Imputing missing values
Calculate number of rows in activity data set with NA rows

	sum(is.na(activity$steps))

[1] 2304

Data frame with mean steps per interval - just renaming to be more descriptive

	stepsPerInt <- actCastInt

Create data frame that we will remove NAs from

	actNoNA <- activity

Merge activity data set with stepsPerInt data set

	actMerge = merge(actNoNA, stepsPerInt, by="interval", suffixes=c(".act", ".spi"))

Get list of indexes where steps value = NA

	naIndex = which(is.na(actNoNA$steps))

Replace NA values with value from steps.spi

	actNoNA[naIndex,"steps"] = actMerge[naIndex,"steps.spi"]

Melt new data frame to prep for casting by date

	actMeltDateNoNA <- melt(actNoNA, id.vars="date", measure.vars="steps", na.rm=FALSE)

Cast data frame to see steps per day

	actCastDateNoNA <- dcast(actMeltDateNoNA, date ~ variable, sum)

Plot histogram with frequency of steps by day

	plot(actCastDateNoNA$date, actCastDateNoNA$steps, type="h", main="Histogram of Daily Steps (Imputted NA Values)", xlab="Date", ylab="Steps", col="gray", lwd=8)
	abline(h=mean(actCastDateNoNA$steps), col="red", lwd=2)

Calculate mean and median of daily steps

	paste("Mean daily steps =", mean(actCastDateNoNA$steps, na.rm=TRUE))

[1] "Mean daily steps = 10889.7992576554"

	paste("Median daily steps =", median(actCastDateNoNA$steps, na.rm=TRUE))

[1] "Median daily steps = 11015"

Original dataset containing NAs: Mean Daily Steps = 10,766.19, Median Daily Steps = 10,765.

Dataset cleaned of NAs: Mean Daily Steps = 10890, Median Daily Steps = 11,015.

1.2% difference for mean, 2.3% difference for median. 

### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

For loop to create new column called "dayOfWeek" and insert whether each date corresponds to a weekday or weekend

	for (i in 1:nrow(actNoNA)) {
	    if (weekdays(actNoNA$date[i]) == "Saturday" | weekdays(actNoNA$date[i]) == "Sunday") {
	        actNoNA$dayOfWeek[i] = "weekend"
	    } else {
	        actNoNA$dayOfWeek[i] = "weekday"
	    }
	}
To create a plot, we must first subset the data

	actWeekday <- subset(actNoNA, dayOfWeek=="weekday")
	actWeekend <- subset(actNoNA, dayOfWeek=="weekend")

Next, we need to process the data for our needs

	actMeltWeekday <- melt(actWeekday, id.vars="interval", measure.vars="steps")
	actMeltWeekend <- melt(actWeekend, id.vars="interval", measure.vars="steps")
	actCastWeekday <- dcast(actMeltWeekday, interval ~ variable, mean)
	actCastWeekend <- dcast(actMeltWeekend, interval ~ variable, mean)

Load plot packages necessary to continue

	library(ggplot2)
	library(gridExtra)

Set plot area to two rows and one column, and then plot charts with mean line in each

	plot1 <- qplot(actCastWeekday$interval, actCastWeekday$steps, geom="line", data=actCastWeekday, main="Steps by Interval - Weekday", xlab="Interval ID", ylab="Number of Steps")
	plot2 <- qplot(actCastWeekend$interval, actCastWeekend$steps, geom="line", data=actCastWeekend, main="Steps by Interval - Weekend", xlab="Interval ID", ylab="Number of Steps")
	grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, nrow=2)
